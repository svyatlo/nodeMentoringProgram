## Task 1.1

### Write a program which reads a string from the standard input `stdin`, reverses it and then writes it to the standard output `stdout`.

- The program should be started via **npm script** using **nodemon** (i.e. `npm run task1-1`).
- The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the first-string processing.
- For example:

    `12345 678`

    `876 54321`

    `test data`

    `atad tset`

## Evaluation criteria

- Task 1.1 is fulfilled to the full extent.
