## Workflow

1. Download/clone this repository to your local workstation.

2. Open the folder with the project in your editor.

3. Switch to the branch you are interested in, for example `git checkout task1` (you will see the links with the subtasks descriptions)

4. Write `npm install` to install all dependences of the project.

5. To run some task implementation please write: `npm run task*-**` (* - number of the task, ** - number of the subtask).

For example `npm run task1-1`
